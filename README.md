# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to the DSA Project!! 🚀  
This project is an open-source collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** implemented in different programming languages. Our goal is to provide a **beginner-friendly, open-source resource** for learners, student, interview and developers everywhere.  
Contributors can add implementations in different languages, and learners can explore how the same algorithm is written across languages.
