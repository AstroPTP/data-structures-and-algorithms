## Security Practices

- All contributions are reviewed before merging  
- Example/demo code should **not** contain sensitive credentials, API keys, or personal data  
- Dependencies should be kept minimal and updated regularly  
- This project does not run as a service; however, contributors should still follow **secure coding guidelines** (avoid unsafe input handling, etc.)
